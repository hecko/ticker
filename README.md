This apps logs Windows session logins/logouts and locks / unlocks into a CSV file so you can generate timesheets easily.

Its not tracking mouse events, its mostly relying on unlock / lock screen events to log information when you star or stop being active on the PC.

It automatically starts with windows and uses a small tray icon to give you access to the log file.

It does not require Admin privileges to install.

Installation - just get the files from bin directory and run the Exe or compile from the enclosed WinForms Project in Visual Studio 2022
